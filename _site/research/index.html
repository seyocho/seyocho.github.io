        <h6 class="title center blue-text"><strong> Overview </strong> </h6>
        I pursue development and applications of high-energy/high-power laser system. Those laser systems have given rise to the breakthrough for both science and industry. Ultra-high-power lasers and high-energy lasers are used in the many kinds of scientific research including the particle acceleration, light-matter interaction, medical and industrial applications. The high-power/high-energy lasers have gone on to significant accomplishments, and, I do not believe that those achievements are all of the potentials those lasers have. Especially, improving the performance of high-energy/high-power lasers will contribute to a better understanding of the materials, and the development of lasers with stable operation at the industrial level will significantly contribute to cutting-edge technologies for everyone. My research interest will be an exploration of all things about light and nature. As a first step, I am conducting research on the following topics:

        <div class="col s12 m12 l6">
        <h6 class="title blue-text"><strong> Thermal distortion of crystal modeling </strong> </h6>
        Several institutes already generated the PW pulses with Ti:sapphire medium. At present, They are trying to develop more-stable operation and high repetition rate not just making PW pulses. I am researching on the thermal effect of Ti:sapphire, one of our group’s main development goals. Many researchers have not been intrigued by Ti:sapphire even though the background knowledge of thermal effects of the laser medium is already well known. There are two reasons for this. One is the thermal durability of Ti:sapphire is good enough to use without the analysis of thermal effects. The other is of analysis of Ti:sapphire is too complex because it’s anisotropic crystal, also its thermal effects are not very serious at that time. So, many researchers only consider the thermal lens effect. However, for high repetition rate operation and fine beam quality, it is essential to analyze the thermal effects. So, I have studied on the thermal effects of Ti:sapphire crystal. Future research of this topic is not limited on Ti:sapphire crystal but I will continue on other anisotropic materials.

        <h6 class="title blue-text"><strong> Laser-induced surface treatments </strong> </h6>
        I’m also involved in the project about metal surface treatment with. the high-energy laser. I think this is a good topic to think about how to construct an optical system that conveys a beam to the target. I believe researchers in this field are highly needed both skills of scientists and engineers. Not only this project, in other projects our group try to learn knowledges and skills of the both. By the way, at present, we have confirmed that the fatigue strength and corrosion strength of metal are significantly improved by using laser peening, and we are now studying whether it can improve the other property of materials like CHF.

        <h6 class="title blue-text"><strong> Development of ns, 10 J-class pulsed laser with arbitrary shaping </strong> </h6>
        Development of nano-second pulse laser is one of the big topics in my group and I have been involved in this for years. Our group is working on the development of NIR, 10 ns, 10 J, 10 Hz pulse laser, and I hope to share the results about this projects very soon.
